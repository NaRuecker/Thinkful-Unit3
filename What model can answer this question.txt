1.Predict the running times of prospective Olympic sprinters using data from the last 20 Olympics.
Regression problem

2.You have more features (columns) than rows in your dataset.
Reduce number of features by using PCA or if there is little correlation between the features use Lasso.

3.Identify the most important characteristic predicting likelihood of being jailed before age 20.
Naive Bayes.

4.Implement a filter to “highlight” emails that might be important to the recipient.
Naive Bayes.

5.You have 1000+ features.
Reduce number of features by using PCA or if there is little correlation between the features use Lasso.

6.Predict whether someone who adds items to their cart on a website will purchase the items.
Classification

7.Your dataset dimensions are 982400 x 500.
Try to reduce feature complexity using PCA or correlation.

8.Identify faces in an image.
This data will be very complex, not human interpretable, probably a neuronal net would be good.

9.Predict which of three flavors of ice cream will be most popular with boys vs girls.
